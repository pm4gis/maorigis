title: Metadata and documentation



---



## Purpose



This page explains how to document Māori geospatial data so context, authority, and limitations are not lost.



## Why metadata matters



Metadata carries meaning.

Without it, data can be misused, misunderstood, or separated from its whakapapa.



## Key metadata elements



In addition to technical fields, include:

- Data authority and kaitiaki

- Purpose and intended use

- Conditions and restrictions

- Cultural considerations

- Known limitations



## Recording whakapapa



Where appropriate, document:

- How the data was created

- Who was involved

- What sources were used

- What decisions shaped it



This supports transparency and trust.



## Language and naming



Use:

- Correct place names

- Agreed spellings

- Appropriate descriptions



Avoid neutral language that removes context.



## Keeping documentation current



Metadata should be:

- Updated as data changes

- Reviewed periodically

- Treated as part of the dataset



Out of date metadata creates risk.
