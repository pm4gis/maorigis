## Purpose



This page provides practical guidance for respectful engagement in Māori GIS projects, with an emphasis on relationships, co design, and long term trust.



## Begin with relationships



Effective mapping starts with people.

- Take time to understand context and history

- Be clear about who you represent

- Listen before proposing solutions



Rushing technical work undermines trust.



## Co design over extraction



GIS should be done with communities.

- Define questions together

- Shape outputs collaboratively

- Share control over decisions



Local knowledge is expertise.



## Setting expectations early



Discuss at the start:

- Purpose and scope

- Timeframes

- Resourcing and constraints

- Ownership and access

- What happens when the project ends



Written agreements support clarity.



## Respecting diversity



Māori communities are not uniform.

- Iwi, hapū, and whānau have different views

- Internal differences may exist

- Avoid assuming a single voice



GIS must adapt to local context.



## Returning value



Value may include:

- Maps and data returned to communities

- Skills transfer and training

- Improved decision making

- Support for local aspirations



Avoid one way data flows.



## Maintaining relationships



Engagement does not end at delivery.

- Share updates

- Provide access to outputs

- Remain available for questions



Trust is built over time.
