title: Ethics and consent
---
## Purpose



This page outlines ethical responsibilities when creating, analysing, and sharing Māori geospatial data. It focuses on trust, care, and long term impacts rather than minimum legal requirements.



## Informed consent in mapping projects



Consent must be:

- Given before data is collected or digitised

- Based on clear explanation of purpose and risks

- Specific to the agreed use

- Able to be withdrawn



Mapping data does not create consent by default.



## Consent over time



GIS projects often evolve. New layers, new outputs, or new audiences may change the original intent.



Good practice includes:

- Checking consent when scope changes

- Not assuming consent applies to new uses

- Revisiting decisions when publishing or sharing



## Sensitive spatial data



Sensitive data may include:

- Wāhi tapu and wāhi tūpuna

- Urupā and burial sites

- Cultural landscapes

- Resources under pressure or dispute



Sensitivity is not always obvious from the data itself and must be understood through engagement.



## Managing visibility and access



Options for reducing risk include:

- Generalising locations

- Masking attributes

- Limiting scale or resolution

- Using role based access controls

- Publishing summaries instead of raw data



Public does not mean appropriate.



## Avoiding harm



Potential harms include:

- Enabling exploitation or vandalism

- Undermining cultural authority

- Misinterpretation without context

- Pressure to disclose more data



Ethical practice requires actively thinking about misuse, not just intended use.



## Accountability



Ethical decisions should be:

- Documented

- Reviewable

- Able to be explained



Responsibility continues after publication.
