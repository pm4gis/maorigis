\## Purpose



This page outlines how to ensure Māori GIS data is accurate, appropriate, and culturally correct.



\## Technical accuracy



Check:

\- Spatial accuracy

\- Projection and scale

\- Data integrity



Technical errors undermine trust.



\## Cultural validation



Validation should include:

\- Correct place names

\- Appropriate representation

\- Review by knowledge holders

\- Respect for tikanga



Technical correctness is not enough.



\## Review processes



Good practice includes:

\- Peer review

\- Community sign off where appropriate

\- Clear approval points



Validation should be planned, not rushed.



\## Managing uncertainty



Be clear about:

\- Known gaps

\- Assumptions

\- Confidence levels



Honesty builds credibility.
