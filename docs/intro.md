title: Māori GIS in Practice
sidebar_label: Introduction
---



This site is a practical guide to using Geographic Information Systems in Māori contexts in Aotearoa New Zealand. It is written for iwi and hapū staff, Māori organisations, and practitioners who work with Māori communities and need to use GIS as part of their role.



It is not an academic text. It is not software documentation. It is a working guide for people who need to get useful, safe results with real tools.



\## Who this is for



This guide is for:



\* Iwi and hapū staff who use GIS alongside many other responsibilities

\* Māori trusts, incorporations, PSGEs, rūnanga, and kaupapa Māori organisations

\* Council, Crown, and consultancy staff working directly with Māori communities

\* People who are new to GIS, or who have basic skills and want to work more confidently



It assumes you are practical, time constrained, and outcome focused.



\## What this guide covers



This guide focuses on the kinds of work Māori GIS is actually used for:



\* Mapping whenua and Māori land interests

\* Supporting taiao and environmental projects

\* Working with place names and cultural landscapes

\* Managing sites and areas of significance

\* Producing maps and visuals for governance and reporting

\* Publishing maps, web content, and StoryMaps safely



It covers the tools most commonly used:



\* QGIS

\* ArcGIS Pro

\* ArcGIS Online

\* Google Earth Pro



The guide shows where these tools are similar, where they differ, and how to choose between them.



\## What makes Māori GIS different



GIS is not neutral. Decisions about what is mapped, how it is stored, and who can see it are value laden decisions.



In Māori contexts, GIS work often involves:



\* Whenua with layered interests and histories

\* Knowledge that cannot be treated as open data

\* Information that may be accurate but still inappropriate to publish

\* Multiple audiences with different rights to access information



Because of this, tikanga, consent, and governance are treated as part of the technical workflow throughout this guide. They are not side notes.



\## What this guide does not do



This guide does not:



\* Tell iwi how they should govern their data

\* Publish or reproduce culturally sensitive information

\* Assume all Māori contexts are the same

\* Replace local kōrero, tikanga, or decision making



Every iwi, hapū, and community is different. This guide provides safe defaults and practical patterns, not rules.



\## How to use this guide



You do not need to read this site in order.



Each section is organised by task and type of work. You can jump straight to what you need.



Each page follows a consistent pattern:



\* What the task is for

\* When to use it

\* Tool differences where relevant

\* Decisions you need to make

\* Safe defaults

\* Common mistakes



The goal is that you can read a page, apply it immediately, and move on.



\## A note on language and naming



This site uses plain New Zealand English. Māori terms are used where they are appropriate and commonly understood in Māori GIS practice.



Macrons are used in content. They are not used in URLs or file names to keep the site simple and robust.



\## Status of this guide



This guide is a living document. It will grow and improve over time as tools change and practice evolves.



If you are using this in real work, you are the intended audience.
