:::info
This site is a practical guide to using Geographic Information Systems in Māori contexts in Aotearoa New Zealand. It is written for iwi and hapū staff, Māori organisations, and practitioners who work with Māori communities and need to use GIS as part of their role.

It is not an academic text. It is not software documentation. It is a working guide for people who need to get useful, safe results with real tools.

## Who this is for

This guide is written for people who use GIS in real Māori contexts, often alongside many other responsibilities, and who need approaches that are practical, respectful, and fit for purpose.

This guide is for:
- Iwi and hapū staff who use GIS alongside many other responsibilities  
- Māori trusts, incorporations, PSGEs, rūnanga, and kaupapa Māori organisations  
- Council, Crown, and consultancy staff working directly with Māori communities  
- People who are new to GIS, or who have basic skills and want to work more confidently  

It assumes you are practical, time constrained, and outcome focused.

## What this guide covers

This guide focuses on the kinds of work Māori GIS is actually used for in practice, rather than abstract or theoretical examples.

It covers:
- Mapping whenua and Māori land interests, including layered ownership and use  
- Supporting taiao and environmental projects, such as monitoring and reporting  
- Working with place names, cultural landscapes, and local geographies  
- Managing sites and areas of significance in a careful and controlled way  
- Producing maps and visuals for governance, reporting, and kōrero  
- Publishing maps, web content, and StoryMaps safely and appropriately  

Examples are based in Aotearoa New Zealand and reflect common real world situations.

## What makes Māori GIS different

GIS is not neutral. Decisions about what is mapped, how it is stored, and who can see it are decisions about power, authority, and responsibility.

In Māori contexts, GIS work often involves:
- Whenua with deep histories, whakapapa, and ongoing relationships  
- Knowledge that may be accurate but still inappropriate to share widely  
- Information that is taonga and needs to be treated with care  
- Multiple audiences with different rights to access information  

Because of this, tikanga, consent, and governance are treated as part of the technical workflow throughout this guide. They are not side notes or optional extras.
