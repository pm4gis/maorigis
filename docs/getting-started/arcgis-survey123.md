Survey123 is a form based data collection tool developed by :contentReference\[oaicite:1]{index=1}. It is part of the ArcGIS ecosystem and is designed for structured surveys that can include location, photos, and attachments.



Survey123 is not GIS software. It is a data capture tool that feeds into GIS.



\## What Survey123 is good for



Survey123 works well for:



\- Field data collection with phones or tablets

\- Structured surveys with clear schemas

\- Collecting locations, photos, and observations together

\- Monitoring programmes and repeat visits

\- Projects that need controlled questions and responses



It is commonly used by councils, Crown agencies, and organisations already using ArcGIS Online.



\## Why it is used in Māori contexts



Survey123 can work well when:



\- The organisation already has ArcGIS Online

\- Clear governance and permissions are in place

\- Data needs to flow into dashboards or maps

\- Multiple staff are collecting data consistently



It supports structured collection, which reduces ambiguity.



\## Key things to understand early



Survey123 relies on:



\- An ArcGIS Online organisation

\- User accounts and licences

\- Hosted feature layers

\- Sharing settings that affect visibility



Decisions made at setup time affect risk later.



\## Managing sensitive information



Good practice includes:



\- Avoid collecting personal data unless required

\- Separate identifying information from observation data

\- Use clear field names and descriptions

\- Restrict sharing at the layer level

\- Use view layers for wider access



Always check whether downloads and exports are enabled.



\## Typical workflow with GIS



A common pattern is:



1\. Design the survey with only required fields

2\. Test it thoroughly before use

3\. Collect data in the field

4\. Review and clean data in GIS

5\. Publish summaries or views, not raw data



Treat Survey123 as the front door, not the data store.



\## Limits to be aware of



Survey123 is not suitable when:



\- Work must remain fully offline long term

\- You need survey grade spatial accuracy

\- You do not control the ArcGIS environment

\- The kaupapa requires local file based storage only



\## Where this fits in the guide



Survey123 is useful for structured data capture in organisations already committed to ArcGIS Online. Use it with strong governance and clear decisions about what is shared.
