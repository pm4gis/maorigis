Google Earth is a free mapping and visualisation tool that lets you explore the world using satellite imagery, aerial photos, terrain, and simple map layers. It is widely used because it is easy to access and requires very little setup.



Google Earth is best understood as a visual exploration and communication tool rather than a full GIS application.



\### What Google Earth is good for



Google Earth is commonly used for:



\- Exploring whenua and landscapes in 3D

\- Visualising places quickly without technical setup

\- Supporting kōrero in hui and workshops

\- Viewing change over time using historical imagery

\- Creating simple place based stories and screenshots

\- Sharing locations and ideas with people unfamiliar with GIS



For many iwi and hapū contexts, Google Earth is a useful starting point because it feels familiar and intuitive.



\### Versions of Google Earth



There are three main versions you may encounter:



\- Google Earth (web) runs in a browser and requires an internet connection

\- Google Earth Pro runs as a desktop application and allows more features

\- Google Earth on mobile devices for quick viewing in the field



For most practical work, Google Earth Pro on a desktop computer is the most useful option.



\### What Google Earth is not



Google Earth is not:



\- A full GIS analysis tool

\- A reliable source of authoritative boundaries

\- A database or data management system

\- Suitable for managing sensitive or restricted data



Imagery in Google Earth looks precise, but it is not always current or spatially accurate enough for decision making on its own.



\### Using Google Earth with Māori contexts



Google Earth is often used to support kōrero about place, whakapapa, history, and landscape. It can be very effective for this purpose.



When using Google Earth with Māori data, consider:



\- Whether sites or locations are sensitive

\- Who will see the screen or shared files

\- Whether imagery reveals information that should remain private

\- How screenshots or files might be reused later

Just because imagery is publicly visible does not mean it is appropriate to use or share in all contexts. Mana, trust, and tikanga still apply.

\### Common tasks in Google Earth



Typical tasks include:



\- Searching for places and landmarks

\- Adding placemarks for important locations

\- Drawing simple lines and areas

\- Measuring distance and area

\- Turning imagery layers on and off

\- Viewing historical imagery to see change over time



These tasks are well suited to early stage exploration and discussion.



\### File types used by Google Earth



Google Earth uses simple file formats:



\- KML and KMZ files for points, lines, and areas

\- Image overlays

\- Simple descriptive text and links



These files are easy to share but can also be copied and redistributed easily.



\### Strengths of Google Earth



Google Earth works well when:



\- You need to communicate ideas quickly

\- The audience is not technical

\- Visual context is more important than precision

\- You are exploring possibilities rather than making final decisions



It is especially useful for hui, workshops, and early planning conversations.



\### Limitations to be aware of



Be cautious when:



\- Treating imagery as authoritative

\- Assuming boundaries are correct

\- Sharing files without controls

\- Using Google Earth as the only source of evidence



Google Earth should support decision making, not replace it.



\### How Google Earth fits into this guide



In this guide, Google Earth is used as an entry point for understanding place and spatial thinking. It is often the first tool people use before moving into more detailed GIS work with tools such as QGIS.



Later sections will show how ideas explored in Google Earth can be taken into a GIS environment when more structure, accuracy, and control are required.
