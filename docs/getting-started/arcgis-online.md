ArcGIS Online is a web based GIS platform used to store, manage, analyse, and share spatial data through maps and applications. It is widely used across the public sector in Aotearoa New Zealand and is often the main GIS platform organisations already have access to.



ArcGIS Online works through a web browser. Data, maps, and apps are stored online rather than on a local computer. This makes it powerful for collaboration and sharing, but it also introduces responsibilities around access, permissions, and data care.



\### What ArcGIS Online is good for



ArcGIS Online is commonly used for:



\- Creating and sharing interactive web maps

\- Collaborating across teams and organisations

\- Publishing maps and apps for non technical users

\- Supporting engagement, reporting, and communication

\- Combining GIS with forms, dashboards, and stories

\- Working across devices without installing software



For Māori organisations, ArcGIS Online can be valuable when information needs to be shared clearly with trustees, staff, partners, or the wider community.



\### Core concepts to understand



ArcGIS Online is built around a few key ideas:



\- Content lives in an online organisation

\- Users have accounts with roles and permissions

\- Maps and data can be private, shared, or public

\- Apps sit on top of maps to present information clearly



Understanding these concepts is more important than knowing every tool.



\### Using ArcGIS Online with Māori organisations



ArcGIS Online is often used by iwi, hapū, trusts, incorporations, and PSGEs to support planning, reporting, and communication.



Common uses include:



\- Visualising rohe, assets, and interests

\- Supporting post settlement governance and planning

\- Sharing information with trustees or committees

\- Communicating projects to partners and agencies

\- Supporting environmental and taiao monitoring

\- Telling stories about place and kaupapa



The platform is well suited to sharing kōrero visually, but it must be used with care.



\### Data responsibility and control



ArcGIS Online makes sharing very easy. This is both a strength and a risk.



When using ArcGIS Online, always be clear about:



\- Who owns the data

\- Where the data is stored

\- Who can view, edit, or download it

\- Whether content is public, internal, or restricted

Before uploading whenua, sites, or culturally sensitive information, confirm permissions and expectations. Once data is online, control can be harder to regain.

\### Apps in ArcGIS Online



ArcGIS Online includes many apps that present GIS information without requiring GIS skills.



Common app types include:



\- Map viewers for exploring data

\- Dashboards for showing live information

\- Story based apps for narrative and engagement

\- Simple viewers for trustees and decision makers

\- Mobile friendly apps for field or site use



Apps are often where the real value sits for non technical users.



\### StoryMaps



StoryMaps combine maps, text, images, and media into a scrolling narrative.



They are often used to:



\- Explain history and context

\- Share kaupapa and project stories

\- Support engagement with communities

\- Present information in a clear and approachable way



For Māori organisations, StoryMaps are useful for sharing kōrero about whenua, taiao, projects, and aspirations in a way that is accessible and visual.



They are not suitable for sensitive or restricted information unless carefully controlled.



\### Dashboards



Dashboards present information using maps, charts, and indicators.



They are commonly used for:



\- Monitoring projects or programmes

\- Tracking environmental indicators

\- Showing asset or activity status

\- Supporting governance reporting



Dashboards work best when the audience needs a clear snapshot rather than detailed analysis.



\### Strengths of ArcGIS Online



ArcGIS Online works well when:



\- Many people need access to the same information

\- Maps need to be shared widely and easily

\- Non technical users need to interact with maps

\- Storytelling and communication are important

\- Integration with forms and apps is useful



It reduces technical barriers for viewing and using GIS.



\### Limitations to be aware of



Be cautious when:



\- Treating ArcGIS Online as the only copy of data

\- Uploading sensitive or culturally restricted information

\- Assuming default settings are appropriate

\- Relying on online access in all situations

\- Using apps without understanding data sources



ArcGIS Online is not a replacement for clear governance, data management, or tikanga.



\### ArcGIS Online and other tools



ArcGIS Online is often used alongside other GIS tools.



Common patterns include:



\- Data prepared in desktop GIS, then published online

\- Exploration in Google Earth, followed by structured maps online

\- Online apps for viewing, with analysis done elsewhere



It works best as part of a wider GIS approach rather than on its own.



\### How ArcGIS Online fits into this guide



In this guide, ArcGIS Online is presented as a platform for sharing and communication. It is especially useful once data and purpose are clear and the audience needs access without technical barriers.



Later sections will focus on choosing the right tool for the task, deciding what should be shared online, and understanding responsibilities when publishing maps and apps.
