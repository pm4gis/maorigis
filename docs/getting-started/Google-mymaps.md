Google My Maps is a simple web based mapping tool provided by :contentReference\[oaicite:0]{index=0}. It allows users to create basic maps with points, lines, and areas on top of Google imagery.



It should be treated as a visual and collaborative sketching tool, not a GIS system.



\## What Google My Maps is good for



Google My Maps works well for:



\- Quick maps to support kōrero

\- Collaborative mapping with non technical users

\- Capturing approximate locations and notes

\- Sharing a simple map via a link

\- Early stage thinking before formal GIS work



It is often used where speed and familiarity matter more than accuracy or structure.



\## Why it appears in Māori GIS workflows



Google My Maps is sometimes used because:



\- Many people already have Google accounts

\- The interface is simple and familiar

\- Multiple people can add content easily

\- It works well in workshops and hui



It can support engagement and discussion, but it should not be treated as a source of truth.



\## Limits and risks



Be cautious of:



\- No real data governance controls

\- Very limited attribute structure

\- No meaningful access control

\- Easy oversharing by link

\- No clear separation between draft and final



Do not store sensitive kōrero, sites, or locations in Google My Maps.



\## Using My Maps safely



Good practice includes:



\- Keep content high level and generalised

\- Avoid precise locations where sensitivity exists

\- Treat maps as temporary or draft

\- Export and migrate content to GIS if it becomes important



\## Moving content into GIS



If a My Maps project becomes useful:



1\. Export as KML

2\. Open the file in QGIS or ArcGIS Pro

3\. Check geometry and attributes

4\. Rebuild the dataset properly

5\. Store and manage it in a controlled environment



\## Where this fits in the guide



Google My Maps is an entry level visual tool. Use it for early kōrero only. Move to QGIS or ArcGIS Pro for anything ongoing, sensitive, or authoritative.
