Google My Maps is a simple web based mapping tool that lets users create custom maps with points, lines, and areas on top of Google basemaps. It is best treated as a lightweight visual tool, not a GIS system.

## What Google My Maps is good for

Google My Maps works well for:

- Quick maps to support kōrero
- Collaborative mapping with non technical users
- Capturing approximate locations and notes
- Sharing a simple map via a link
- Early stage thinking before formal GIS work

## What it is not suitable for

Google My Maps should not be used for:

- Authoritative boundaries
- Sensitive or restricted information
- Long term data storage
- Accurate spatial analysis
- Complex attribute data

## Using My Maps safely

Good practice includes:

- Keep content high level and generalised
- Avoid precise locations where sensitivity exists
- Treat maps as temporary or draft
- Export and migrate content to GIS if it becomes important

## Moving content into GIS

If a My Maps project becomes useful:

1. Export as KML or KMZ
2. Open the file in QGIS or ArcGIS Pro
3. Check geometry and attributes
4. Rebuild the dataset properly in a controlled environment
5. Store and manage it with clear permissions and metadata
