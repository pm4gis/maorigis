ArcGIS Field Maps is a mobile application by :contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2} used for collecting, viewing, and updating spatial data in the field.



It combines mapping, data capture, and navigation in a single app.



\## What Field Maps is good for



Field Maps is suited to:



\- Recording site visits and inspections

\- Updating existing GIS datasets

\- Navigating to known locations

\- Collecting photos and notes linked to features

\- Repeat monitoring and asset checks



It works best when datasets are already well designed.



\## Strengths in organisational settings



Field Maps is effective when:



\- Data schemas are controlled

\- Staff have defined roles

\- Locations are not highly sensitive

\- Outputs feed into dashboards or reports



It supports consistency across teams.



\## Risks and care points



Be careful with:



\- Editing authoritative datasets in the field

\- Accidental syncing of sensitive updates

\- Device sharing between users

\- Default sharing and export settings



Always test workflows with non sensitive data first.



\## Where this fits in the guide



Field Maps is an operational tool. It works best after data has been carefully designed in ArcGIS Pro and publishing decisions are already clear.
