ArcGIS Field Maps is a mobile application used to view maps, collect new features, and update existing GIS data in the field. It is part of the ArcGIS platform and works with ArcGIS Online web maps and feature layers.

## What Field Maps is good for

Field Maps is suited to:

- Navigating to known sites and assets
- Updating existing datasets while in the field
- Recording site visits, inspections, and observations
- Capturing photos and notes linked to features
- Repeat monitoring where data needs to remain consistent over time

## Where it fits in Māori GIS workflows

Field Maps works best when:

- Your datasets are already well designed and controlled
- Editing permissions are clearly defined
- Sensitive layers are separated and access controlled
- Your organisation has a clear publish and review process

Treat Field Maps as an operational tool. The quality of results depends on the schema, the rules, and the governance behind the layers.

## Editing risk and safe defaults

Editing in the field can introduce risk, especially with authoritative layers.

Safer defaults:

- Do not allow editing on layers that are intended only for viewing
- Use view layers for read only sharing
- Keep restricted layers in restricted groups
- Test the workflow with non sensitive data first

ArcGIS Online sharing overview: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/overview-of-sharing.htm

## Typical workflow

1. Prepare datasets and schemas in ArcGIS Pro
2. Publish layers to ArcGIS Online
3. Create view layers for any wider sharing
4. Build a web map designed for field use
5. Configure Field Maps settings and offline areas if needed
6. Train users on what to capture and what not to capture
7. Review incoming edits regularly and correct issues early
