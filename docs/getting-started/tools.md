This page gives a practical overview of the GIS tools most commonly used in Aotearoa New Zealand, and how they are typically used in Māori contexts. It is not a product comparison or endorsement. The aim is to help you choose tools that fit your kaupapa, your team, and your constraints.

## The reality of mixed tool environments

Most Māori GIS work happens in mixed environments. You may be using more than one tool at the same time, or working alongside organisations that use different platforms.

It is common to see combinations such as:
- QGIS for analysis and offline work  
- ArcGIS Pro for compatibility with council or Crown partners  
- ArcGIS Online for sharing maps and StoryMaps  
- Google Earth Pro for quick visualisation and kōrero  

The right choice is often about context and relationships, not technical superiority.

## QGIS

QGIS is a free and open source desktop GIS application. It is widely used across Aotearoa and internationally.

QGIS is well suited to Māori contexts because:
- It works fully offline, supporting data sovereignty and local control  
- Files are stored locally, making it easier to manage access  
- It supports a wide range of open data formats  
- It has strong community support and documentation  

Typical uses:
- Mapping whenua and land interests  
- Environmental and taiao analysis  
- Working with large or complex datasets  
- Preparing data before sharing  

Things to be aware of:
- Sharing is manual, so copies can spread easily if not managed  
- There is no built-in access control  
- Collaboration requires agreed file management practices  

## ArcGIS Pro

ArcGIS Pro is a desktop GIS application commonly used by councils, Crown agencies, and larger organisations.

ArcGIS Pro is useful when:
- You need compatibility with partner organisations  
- You are working within an existing ArcGIS environment  
- You need advanced cartography or specific tools  

Typical uses:
- Producing maps for formal reporting  
- Working with shared enterprise datasets  
- Preparing data for ArcGIS Online  

Things to be aware of:
- Requires a paid licence  
- Often tied to organisational IT systems  
- Data governance is partly controlled by platform configuration  

## ArcGIS Online

ArcGIS Online is a web based GIS platform for sharing maps, layers, and StoryMaps.

It is commonly used for:
- Sharing information with governance or community  
- Creating interactive web maps and dashboards  
- StoryMaps that combine maps, text, and images  

In Māori contexts, ArcGIS Online requires careful use.

Strengths:
- Easy to share information visually  
- Fine grained access controls  
- Familiar to many partner organisations  

Risks:
- It is easy to overshare by accident  
- Sharing settings can change visibility quickly  
- Data may be stored offshore  

A safe approach is to:
- Keep sensitive data offline  
- Publish derived or generalised outputs  
- Review sharing settings before and after publishing  

## Google Earth Pro

Google Earth Pro is a free desktop tool focused on visualisation rather than analysis.

It is useful for:
- Quick kōrero and visual explanation  
- Exploring landscapes and places  
- Creating simple overlays and screenshots  

Google Earth Pro is not a full GIS and should not be used as a primary data store.

Things to be aware of:
- Limited analysis capability  
- Unclear long term storage and governance  
- Not suitable for managing authoritative datasets  

## Choosing tools based on kaupapa

When choosing tools, ask:
- What is the purpose of this mahi  
- Who needs to see the output  
- Where should the data live  
- What skills does the team already have  
- What constraints exist around cost and IT  

There is no single correct stack. A kaupapa driven approach often leads to using different tools at different stages of the work.

## A note on data and mana

Tools do not carry mana, people and relationships do.

Regardless of platform:
- Be clear about kaitiakitanga and responsibility  
- Keep consent and permissions visible  
- Avoid default sharing behaviours  
- Document decisions and assumptions  

Good GIS practice supports mana and trust. Poor practice damages both, even when the maps look good.
