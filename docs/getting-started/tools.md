:::info
This page gives a practical overview of the GIS tools most commonly used in Aotearoa New Zealand, and how they are typically used in Māori contexts. It is not a product comparison or endorsement. The aim is to help you choose tools that fit your kaupapa, your team, and your constraints.

## Te ao tūturu, mixed tool environments

Most Māori GIS work happens in mixed environments. You may use more than one tool, or work alongside organisations that use different platforms.

Common combinations include:

- QGIS for analysis and offline work
- ArcGIS Pro for compatibility with council or Crown partners
- ArcGIS Online for sharing maps, apps, and StoryMaps
- Google Earth Pro for quick visualisation and kōrero

The right choice is often about relationships, constraints, and the audience for the output.

## QGIS

QGIS is a free and open source desktop GIS application.

Why it often works well in Māori contexts:

- Works offline, supporting local control
- Files are stored where you choose, making access easier to manage
- Supports open data formats
- Strong community support and documentation

Typical uses:

- Mapping whenua and land interests
- Taiao analysis and overlays
- Working with large datasets
- Preparing data before sharing

Things to be aware of:

- Sharing is manual, copies can spread if not managed
- No built in access control
- Collaboration needs agreed file management practices

## ArcGIS Pro

ArcGIS Pro is a desktop GIS application commonly used by councils, Crown agencies, and larger organisations.

Useful when:

- You need compatibility with partner organisations
- You are working within an existing ArcGIS environment
- You need advanced cartography or structured data management

Typical uses:

- Formal reporting maps
- Enterprise style data workflows
- Preparing layers for ArcGIS Online

Things to be aware of:

- Requires a licence and account management
- Often tied to organisational IT systems

## ArcGIS Online

ArcGIS Online is a web based platform for sharing maps, layers, and apps.

Common uses:

- Sharing with governance or community
- Interactive web maps and dashboards
- StoryMaps that combine maps, text, and images
- Field data capture through forms and mobile apps

Strengths:

- Easy visual sharing
- Access control through users and groups
- Familiar to many partner organisations

Risks:

- Easy to overshare by accident
- Sharing settings can change visibility quickly

Safe approach:

- Keep sensitive data offline
- Publish derived or generalised outputs
- Check layer sharing settings every time

## Google Earth Pro

Google Earth Pro is a free desktop tool focused on visualisation rather than analysis.

Useful for:

- Quick kōrero and visual explanation
- Exploring landscapes and places
- Simple overlays and screenshots

Things to be aware of:

- Limited analysis capability
- Not suitable for managing authoritative datasets

## He aronga kaupapa, choosing tools based on purpose

When choosing tools, ask:

- What is the kaupapa and purpose of the mahi
- Who needs to see the output
- Where should the data live
- What skills the team already has
- What constraints exist around cost and IT

There is no single correct stack. A kaupapa driven approach often uses different tools at different stages.

## He kōrero mō te mana, a note on responsibility

Tools do not carry mana. People and relationships do.

Regardless of platform:

- Keep consent and permissions visible
- Avoid default sharing behaviours
- Document decisions and assumptions
- Treat sensitive kōrero and locations with care

Good GIS practice supports trust. Poor practice damages it, even when the maps look good.
