QGIS is a free, open source mapping application used to view, analyse, and create maps using spatial data. It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux and is widely used in Aotearoa New Zealand by councils, consultants, community groups, and iwi organisations.



QGIS is well suited to practical everyday GIS work. It allows you to work with your own data, public data, and locally stored files without needing an online account or subscription.

QGIS is pronounced “Q G I S”. Some people say “Q-gis”, others say “Q-G-I-S”. Both are common.

\### What QGIS is good for



QGIS is commonly used for:



\- Viewing and exploring spatial data

\- Creating maps for reports, hui, and planning discussions

\- Combining data from different sources into one view

\- Working with whenua, taiao, assets, boundaries, and projects

\- Simple spatial analysis such as buffers, overlays, and selections

\- Working offline or in restricted environments



QGIS works well when you want control over your data and how it is stored and used.



\### What QGIS is not



QGIS is not:



\- A database by itself

\- A records management system

\- A replacement for organisational decision making

\- Automatically accurate just because data is mapped



Good outcomes still depend on good data, clear purpose, and sound judgement.
