ArcGIS Pro is a desktop GIS application designed for advanced mapping, data management, and spatial analysis. It is used where more structure, accuracy, and control are required than web based tools can provide.



ArcGIS Pro runs on Windows and connects to online platforms such as ArcGIS Online, but it is primarily a desktop tool for people doing hands on GIS work.



\### Who ArcGIS Pro is for



ArcGIS Pro is suited to:



\- Dedicated GIS practitioners

\- Analysts working with complex datasets

\- Organisations managing large or structured spatial data

\- Advanced users supporting others through maps and apps



For Māori organisations, ArcGIS Pro is often used by a small number of skilled users supporting wider governance, planning, or operational needs.



\### Licensing options



ArcGIS Pro requires a licence. Common options relevant to Māori organisations include:



\- Personal use licences for individuals

\- Community or not for profit licences for eligible organisations

\- Licences linked to an ArcGIS Online organisation



Licensing is managed through accounts rather than installation keys. This means access and roles should be managed deliberately.



\### What ArcGIS Pro is good for



ArcGIS Pro is commonly used for:



\- Managing and cleaning spatial datasets

\- Working with large or complex data

\- Creating authoritative maps

\- Advanced spatial analysis

\- Preparing data for publishing online

\- Managing coordinate systems and projections

\- Working with enterprise databases



It is often the tool used to prepare data before sharing it through web maps or apps.



\### Data management and structure



ArcGIS Pro is strong at structured data management.



It supports:



\- File geodatabases

\- Enterprise geodatabases

\- Versioned editing workflows

\- Controlled schemas and attributes

\- Clear separation between raw data and outputs



This makes it suitable for long term datasets such as rohe boundaries, assets, environmental monitoring, and planning layers.



\### Using ArcGIS Pro with Māori data



ArcGIS Pro provides powerful tools that must be used carefully.



When working with Māori data, consider:



\- Clear separation between sensitive and shareable data

\- Controlled access to source datasets

\- Naming and structure that reflects tikanga and meaning

\- Documentation of sources, assumptions, and permissions

Advanced tools increase responsibility. Strong data management should support mana and trust, not undermine them.

\### Analysis and processing



ArcGIS Pro supports advanced analysis such as:



\- Spatial joins and overlays

\- Network and distance analysis

\- Raster processing and terrain analysis

\- Environmental and catchment modelling

\- Time enabled data and change analysis



These tools are useful for evidence based kōrero, but outputs should always be explained clearly to non technical audiences.



\### Map production



ArcGIS Pro is well suited to producing high quality maps for:



\- Reports and submissions

\- Planning documents

\- Treaty related evidence

\- Governance and board papers



Map layouts can be controlled carefully, including scale, labels, symbology, and annotation.



\### Working with ArcGIS Online



ArcGIS Pro connects directly to ArcGIS Online.



Common workflows include:



\- Preparing data in ArcGIS Pro

\- Publishing layers to ArcGIS Online

\- Building apps, dashboards, or StoryMaps on top

\- Keeping source data managed locally



This allows technical work to remain controlled while sharing outputs more widely.



\### Strengths of ArcGIS Pro



ArcGIS Pro works well when:



\- Data quality and structure matter

\- Analysis needs to be repeatable and documented

\- Outputs need to be authoritative

\- A small number of skilled users support many others

\- Online sharing needs to be controlled carefully



\### Limitations to be aware of



Be aware that:



\- ArcGIS Pro has a steeper learning curve

\- It requires licensing and account management

\- It runs only on Windows

\- It is not designed for casual or occasional users



It should be used where its capabilities are genuinely needed.



\### ArcGIS Pro and other tools



ArcGIS Pro is often used alongside:



\- QGIS for open or offline workflows

\- Google Earth for early exploration and kōrero

\- ArcGIS Online for sharing and engagement



Choosing ArcGIS Pro should be a deliberate decision based on need, not habit.



\### How ArcGIS Pro fits into this guide



In this guide, ArcGIS Pro is presented as an advanced tool for managing and analysing data that underpins maps and apps used by others. It is most effective when combined with clear purpose, strong data governance, and respect for whenua and mātauranga.
