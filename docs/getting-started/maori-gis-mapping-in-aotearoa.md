# Māori GIS Mapping in Aotearoa

Māori whānau, hapū and iwi across Aotearoa are increasingly using GIS (geographic information systems) to map their whenua (land), taonga (treasured places) and whakapapa (genealogies).  These Māori-led information systems often blend Western GIS technology with *tikanga* (customary practices) and *mātauranga Māori* (Māori knowledge):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. For example, Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research notes that many iwi and hapū have used spatial data for Treaty claims, Māori land planning, iwi/hapū management plans and heritage databases:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. GIS tools help communities **visualise and present** information for resource management, cultural narratives and community planning:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## Data and Software Resources

A wealth of free data and tools supports Māori GIS initiatives. Government agencies provide open data portals such as the **[LINZ Data Service](https://data.linz.govt.nz/)** (Toitū Te Whenua – Land Information NZ) for cadastral, topographic and elevation data.  **Stats NZ** offers demographic and census information by iwi; through the *Te Ara Takatū* service it provides customised iwi datasets at no charge:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  Many standard datasets (e.g. terrain, infrastructure, imagery) are accessible via these portals at no cost.

For software, free platforms are popular.  Open-source GIS like **[QGIS](https://qgis.org/)** are widely used by hapū and iwi.  Manaaki Whenua (Landcare Research) has published a _Basic Spatial Visualisation Package_ including open data and a QGIS manual to help communities get started:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  Professional support is also available: Māori-led consultancies (such as **[Digital Navigators Ltd](https://digitalnavigatorsltd.com/)**) offer cultural mapping services and training, emphasising a holistic Māori worldview in geospatial analysis:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

## Community Projects and Examples

Community initiatives showcase Māori GIS in action.  Cartographer Andrew Douglas-Clifford created an interactive **Map Kiwi** of *Te Reo Māori Place Names*:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  He added thousands of Māori toponyms into **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)** to ensure they are available to all:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.  The Map Kiwi site uses ArcGIS data layers for Māori place names and **marae** (meeting grounds), sourcing official data (e.g. LINZ Tangata Whenua names, NZ Geographic Board) and a marae layer from [Te Puni Kōkiri] (the Ministry for Māori Development):contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  This project illustrates how open data and community effort can populate web maps with Māori names and features.

Another example is the **Manaaki Whenua Basic Spatial Visualisation Package**, which bundles freely available conservation and land-use data into shapefiles usable in QGIS:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.  It is intended to help hapū, whānau and landowners visualise current land use and plan future initiatives (for example, predator control or restoration projects).  Datasets in such packages often include information about species distributions, protected areas and Māori heritage sites.

Governments and institutions also run training programmes.  For instance, Toitū Te Whenua (LINZ) offers *Ngā Poutama Matawhenua*, an online Māori GIS mapping wānanga series aimed at teaching whānau, hapū and iwi how to map their whenua and stories.  Statisticians like Stats NZ and Te Kāhui Raraunga (Māori Stats Department) provide workshops on using census data, and some regions have iwi-led GIS initiatives in partnership with councils or CRIs (Crown Research Institutes).
