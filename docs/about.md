I am Duane Wilkins, a geospatial professional based in Wellington New Zealand with over twenty years experience working with geography, mapping and geographic information systems. My work focuses on practical use of spatial information to support decision making, planning and communication.

I work across central government, local government and community focused projects. Much of my work has involved building geospatial capability rather than delivering one off systems, so people and organisations can confidently use tools and data themselves for ongoing mahi.

I have supported many Māori organisations through Treaty of Waitangi claims and post settlement work. This includes work with iwi and hapū across Te Tai Tokerau, the Whanganui river and surrounding rohe, the Central North Island, Hauraki, Tauranga Moana, and Te Tau Ihu o te Waka a Māui. My role has often involved spatial evidence, mapping of rohe and interests, data preparation, and clear visualisation to support kōrero and decision making.

I have a strong interest in supporting iwi, hapū, Māori trusts, incorporations and rūnanga to use GIS in ways that respect whenua, taonga and mātauranga. This includes practical mapping for planning, visualising information for hui, and supporting long term kaitiakitanga through better understanding of place.

Ko Taupiri te maunga  
Ko Waikato te awa  
Ko Ōhinewai te roto  

Ko Aotearoa te whenua i tupu ake ai au, ā, kei Te Whanganui a Tara au e mahi ana ināianei.  
Nō Airani, nō Wēra, nō Kōtirana ōku tīpuna.

This guidebook exists to make GIS less intimidating and more useful. It is not academic and it is not software documentation. It is written to help people get started, understand responsibilities, and apply GIS to real world mahi in a clear and practical way.

I am based in Wellington and work with teams across Aotearoa. Outside of work I enjoy photography, spending time doing carpentry, and sharing my knowledge of GIS Mapping with others.
