Ko Taupiri te maunga
Ko Waikato te awa
Ko Ōhinewai te roto

Ko Aotearoa te whenua i tupu ake ai au, ā, kei Te Whanganui a Tara au e mahi ana ināianei.
Nō Airani, nō Wēra, nō Kōtirana ōku tīpuna.

I am Duane Wilkins, a geospatial professional based in Wellington, New Zealand, with thirty years experience working with geography, mapping, and geographic information systems. My focus is practical use of spatial information to support decision making, planning, and communication, with a strong emphasis on building capability so teams can do the mahi themselves.

I have worked across central government, local government, and community focused projects. Much of my work has been about helping organisations move from ad hoc maps to repeatable workflows, clear data management, and outputs that people can trust in hui, governance settings, and operational planning.

I have also worked internationally in Iraq and Afghanistan in project management roles for USAID. That experience shaped how I approach complex programmes, delivery under constraints, and working with diverse teams where clarity, good process, and careful communication matter as much as technical skill.

In Aotearoa, I have worked with agencies and organisations including the Department of Conservation (DOC), Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), and the Crown Forestry Rental Trust. Across these roles I have supported mapping and data work that helps people understand place, manage risks, plan investment, communicate options, and deliver projects with confidence.

A significant part of my work has been supporting Māori organisations through Treaty of Waitangi claims and post settlement kaupapa. This includes work with iwi and hapū across Te Tai Tokerau, the Whanganui River and surrounding rohe, the Central North Island, Tuwharetoa, Hauraki, Tauranga Moana, and Te Tau Ihu o te Waka a Māui. My role has often involved geospatial evidence, mapping of rohe and interests, data preparation, and clear visualisation to support kōrero and decision making.

## About

I am committed to supporting iwi, hapū, Māori trusts, incorporations, and rūnanga to use GIS in ways that respect whenua, taonga, and mātauranga. This includes practical mapping for planning, visualising information for hui, and supporting long term kaitiakitanga through better understanding of place, with clear permissions and safe sharing.

This guidebook exists to make GIS less intimidating and more useful. It is not academic and it is not software documentation. It is written to help people get started, understand responsibilities, and apply GIS to real world mahi in a clear and practical way.

I am based in Wellington and work with teams across Aotearoa. Outside of work I enjoy photography, carpentry, and sharing practical GIS knowledge with others.
