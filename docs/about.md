I am Duane Wilkins, a geospatial professional based in Wellington New Zealand with over twenty years experience working with geography, mapping and geographic information systems. My work focuses on helping organisations and communities use spatial information in practical and meaningful ways.

I have worked across central government, local government, and community focused projects, supporting the use of GIS for planning, decision making, asset management, environmental work, and communication. Much of my work has involved building capability rather than just delivering systems, so people can confidently use tools and data themselves.

I have a strong interest in supporting iwi, hapū, Māori trusts, incorporations and rūnanga to use geospatial tools in ways that respect whenua, taonga and kōrero. This includes practical mapping for planning, visualising data for discussion, and supporting long term kaitiakitanga through better information.

This guidebook exists to make GIS less intimidating and more useful. It is not academic and it is not software documentation. It is written to help people get started, understand responsibilities, and apply GIS to real mahi without unnecessary complexity.
