## Pepeha

Ko Waikato te awa  
Ko Taupiri te maunga  

Ko SS Remutaka te waka  
Nō Airani, nō Wēra, nō Kōtirana ōku tīpuna  

I tipu ake au i Waikato  
Kei Te Awakairangi, Te Whanganui a Tara au e noho ana  

Ko Duane Wilkins tōku ingoa
## Ko wai au

I am a geospatial professional based in Wellington, New Zealand. I have worked with geography, mapping, and geographic information systems since the late 1990s. My focus now is sharing the practical use of geospatial information to support decision making, planning, and communication, with an emphasis on building capability so teams and people can do the mahi on their own.

## What I do

I help organisations move from one off maps to repeatable workflows, clear data management, and outputs people can trust in hui, governance settings, and operational planning.

This work commonly includes:

- turning questions into mapping workflows that others can repeat
- setting up tidy data structures, metadata, and versioning habits
- building clear map products for governance, funding, planning, and operations
- choosing sensible tools and keeping it practical for the team using them

## Training and workshops

A big part of my mahi has been teaching and mentoring. I deliver online sessions in GIS, focused on practical demonstrations people can apply straight away. I am not currently available to provide onsite training workshops.

I have delivered many hundreds of training workshops to Māori, government and communities throughout the motu, however my training work is delivered online through Ngā Poutama Matawhenua and this site.

## Experience

I have worked across central government, local government, and community focused projects in Aotearoa. I have also worked internationally in Iraq and Afghanistan in project management roles for USAID. That experience shaped how I approach complex programmes, delivery under constraints, and working with diverse teams where clarity, good process, and careful communication matter as much as technical skill.

I have worked for agencies and organisations including the Department of Conservation (DOC), Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), and the Crown Forestry Rental Trust. Across these roles I have supported mapping and data work that helps people understand place, manage risks, plan investment, communicate options, and deliver projects with confidence.

## Māori GIS kaupapa

A significant part of my work has been supporting Māori organisations through Treaty of Waitangi claims and post settlement kaupapa. This includes work with iwi and hapū across Te Tai Tokerau, the Whanganui River and surrounding rohe, the Central North Island, Tūwharetoa, Hauraki, Tauranga Moana, and Te Tau Ihu o te Waka a Māui.

My role has often involved geospatial evidence, mapping of rohe and interests, data preparation, and clear visualisation to support kōrero and decision making.

## Why this guidebook exists

I am enjoy sharing knowledge to support iwi, hapū, Māori trusts, incorporations, and rūnanga to use GIS in ways that respect their whenua, taonga, and mātauranga. This includes practical mapping for planning, visualising information for hui, and supporting long term kaitiakitanga through better understanding of place, with clear permissions and safe sharing.

This guidebook is designed to make GIS less intimidating and more useful. It is not academic and it is not software documentation. It is written to help people get started, understand responsibilities, and apply GIS to real world mahi in a clear and practical way. You will want to combine this material with video on YouTube, and for software tutorials. 

## Based in Wellington

I am based in Wellington and work with teams across Aotearoa. Outside of work I enjoy photography, DIY, carpentry, and learning about A.I.
