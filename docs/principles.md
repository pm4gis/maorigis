This section sets the foundation for the rest of the guide. It focuses on practical judgement and responsibility rather than theory. The aim is to support good decisions that protect people, relationships, and information while still getting useful work done.
:::

## Begin with purpose

Before opening a GIS tool, be clear about why you are doing the work.

At a minimum, be able to state:
- What decision, kōrero, or outcome this work supports  
- Who the work is for  
- What will be produced, such as a map, dataset, web layer, or report  

This helps avoid creating layers or maps simply because they are easy to produce, rather than because they are needed.

## Relationships are part of the workflow

In Māori contexts, GIS work exists inside relationships. Trust, mana, and accountability matter as much as technical accuracy.

Good practice includes:
- Confirming who has the authority to request and approve the work  
- Being explicit about what will and will not be shared  
- Sharing drafts early, before outputs are treated as final  
- Keeping notes of key decisions, permissions, and assumptions  

If you are unsure, pause and check. It is far easier to slow down than to repair trust after something has been shared inappropriately.

## Understand what is sensitive and why

Not all sensitive information is sensitive for the same reason.

Common reasons information may require care include:
- It relates to wāhi tapu, kōiwi, or cultural practice  
- It describes taonga species, mahinga kai, or resources at risk  
- It identifies individuals, whānau, or private land interests  
- It was shared in confidence or for a specific purpose only  

Do not assume that information is safe to reuse simply because it exists elsewhere. Context and intent still matter.

## Decide access early

A common source of problems is building a dataset first and deciding access later.

Before you begin, decide:
- Who can view the information  
- Who can edit it  
- Who can download or copy it  
- Who can share it further  

If you are using ArcGIS Online, treat sharing settings as a high risk step.  
If you are using QGIS or files on a shared drive, treat file copies and email attachments as a high risk step.

## Use the least exposure approach

A safe default is to expose the minimum amount of information required to achieve the purpose.

Examples include:
- Sharing areas instead of exact point locations  
- Publishing aggregated results instead of raw data  
- Using static maps rather than interactive layers where appropriate  
- Keeping sensitive layers offline and producing outputs from them  

A useful question is: if this were forwarded outside the intended audience, what could go wrong.

## Keep provenance and context visible

GIS layers lose meaning quickly when separated from their context.

For each dataset or map, record:
- Source and date  
- Who provided it and any conditions on use  
- Accuracy and known limitations  
- Intended purpose  
- A contact person or kaitiaki  

This does not need to be complex. A short note in metadata, a text file, or a record in your organisational system is usually enough.

## Be careful with boundaries

Boundaries in GIS are often treated as facts. In practice, they may be layered, contested, or dependent on context.

Good practice includes:
- Labelling what type of boundary is shown  
- Recording the source and date  
- Avoiding presenting uncertain boundaries as final  
- Adding notes that explain what a boundary does and does not represent  

If a boundary has implications for rights, representation, or decision making, confirm it with the appropriate people before publishing.

## Use careful language on maps

Maps communicate strongly, sometimes more strongly than intended.

Practical steps:
- Use plain, neutral labels  
- Include a legend, date, and purpose  
- Add a short note about limitations if needed  
- Where appropriate, include a confidentiality or use statement  

Treat wording, layout, and emphasis as part
