This section sets the tone for the whole guide. It is practical and decision focused. It does not try to define tikanga for every context. It gives safe defaults and questions that help you work in a way that protects relationships, people, and information.
:::

## Start with purpose

Before you open a GIS tool, be clear about the purpose.

Write down, in one sentence:
- What decision or outcome this work supports  
- Who it is for  
- What will be produced, such as a map, dataset, web layer, or report  

This avoids building layers because they are easy to build, rather than because they are needed.

## Treat relationships as part of the workflow

In Māori contexts, GIS work sits inside relationships. If trust is damaged, the technical work does not matter.

Practical behaviours that protect relationships:
- Confirm who has authority to request and approve the work  
- Be explicit about what you will and will not publish  
- Share drafts early, before anything becomes locked in  
- Keep notes about key decisions and permissions  

If you are unsure, pause and check. It is always easier to slow down than to pull back something that has been shared.

## Know what is sensitive and why

Some information is sensitive because it could cause harm if shared. Some is sensitive because it is taonga. Some is sensitive because it is personal, commercial, or legally constrained.

Common types of sensitive spatial information include:
- Sites and areas of significance  
- Locations connected to kōiwi, wāhi tapu, or cultural practice  
- Detailed resource locations, such as mahinga kai or taonga species  
- Personal information tied to properties, homes, or individuals  
- Data provided in confidence by whānau, landowners, or organisations  

Do not assume that “already on the internet” means “safe to reuse”. Context still matters.

## Decide access early

A frequent cause of problems is building a dataset first, then later trying to decide who should be able to see it.

Make an access decision up front:
- Who can view it  
- Who can edit it  
- Who can download it  
- Who can share it onward  

If you are using ArcGIS Online, treat sharing settings as a high risk step. If you are using QGIS, treat file copies and email attachments as a high risk step.

## Use the least exposure approach

A safe default is to share the minimum needed to achieve the purpose.

Examples of least exposure choices:
- Share polygons instead of point locations when the exact location is not required  
- Share aggregated results rather than raw inputs  
- Publish a static map image rather than an interactive layer when appropriate  
- Keep sensitive layers offline and produce outputs from them rather than publishing them  

Ask: if this were forwarded to the wrong person, what could go wrong.

## Keep provenance and context

A GIS layer without context becomes dangerous quickly. People will reuse it, edit it, and interpret it outside its original purpose.

For every dataset you create or curate, capture:
- Source and date  
- Who provided it, and any conditions  
- Accuracy and limitations  
- Intended use  
- Contact person or kaitiaki  

In practice, this can be a simple text file in the same folder, a table in the layer metadata, or a note in your organisational system.

## Be careful with boundaries

Boundaries are often treated as facts in GIS. In real life, they can be contested, layered, or dependent on context.

Safe practices:
- Label the type of boundary, such as rohe, area of interest, planning boundary, or administrative boundary  
- Record the source and date  
- Avoid presenting uncertain boundaries as final  
- Use notes on maps that clarify what a boundary does and does not represent  

If a boundary has implications for rights, representation, or decision making, confirm it with the right people before publishing.

## Use clear language on maps

Maps can communicate more strongly than intended.

Practical tips:
- Use plain labels and avoid loaded terms  
- Add a legend and date  
- Include a short note about purpose and limitations  
- If needed, include a simple confidentiality statement on the map  

If the map will be seen by governance, community, or external agencies, treat layout and wording as part of the quality standard.

## Consent and permissions

When people share information, they often assume it will be used for a specific purpose only.

A safe default is to confirm:
- What the information can be used for  
- Whether it can be shared onward  
- Whether it can be published  
- Whether it can be combined with other datasets  

You do not need complex forms for everything. You do need clarity that is recorded somewhere.

## Practical checklist

Before you publish or share any GIS output, check:
- Purpose is clear and agreed  
- Access is set correctly  
- Sensitive information is handled appropriately  
- Sources and limitations are recorded  
- Map wording is accurate and not overconfident  
- The right people have seen it in draft  

If any one of these is unclear, pause and resolve it before you share.

## A note on tikanga and local practice

Tikanga is local. The right approach in one place can be wrong in another.

This guide uses tikanga concepts in a light way to support safe practice, such as kaitiakitanga, mana, and taonga. It is not a substitute for local guidance.

If you are working with a specific iwi or hapū, treat their preferences as the primary authority.
