Whenua is central to much Māori GIS work. Mapping whenua carries cultural, legal, historical, and relational meaning. It is not only a technical exercise.



\### Common whenua datasets



Typical datasets include:



\- Rohe or area of interest boundaries

\- Land parcels and titles

\- Māori land blocks

\- Custom planning or engagement boundaries

\- Overlays such as zoning or designations



These often come from different sources and may not align perfectly.



\### Understanding boundaries



Not all boundaries represent the same thing.



Some boundaries are:



\- Legal and surveyed

\- Administrative and indicative

\- Cultural or historical

\- Created for a specific kaupapa



Always be clear about what a boundary represents and what it does not.



\### Suggested basic schema for whenua layers



A practical attribute structure may include:



\- Name or identifier

\- Boundary type

\- Source

\- Date created or reviewed

\- Notes on use or limitations



Clarity is more important than complex schemas.



\### Sensitivity and permissions



Some whenua information may be sensitive, disputed, or context specific.



GIS makes copying and sharing easy. This increases responsibility.



:::info

Mapping whenua does not remove obligations around mana, tikanga, or trust. Confirm expectations before sharing.

\### Practical uses



Whenua mapping is commonly used to:



\- Support governance and planning

\- Visualise land interests

\- Overlay projects or assets

\- Support kōrero with partners or agencies

\- Provide context for reports or submissions



Maps should support understanding, not replace discussion.



\### Useful sources



Common public sources include:



\- LINZ Data Service

\- Council open data portals

\- Māori Land Court datasets



Always review licence and use conditions.
