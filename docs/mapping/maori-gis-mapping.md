\# Māori GIS Mapping in Aotearoa



Māori GIS mapping combines Western spatial technology with Māori worldviews and values. It helps iwi, hapū and whānau (tribes, sub-tribes and families) document and manage their whenua (land) and cultural information using maps and data. Such mapping is grounded in \*tikanga\* (customary practice) and \*kaitiakitanga\* (guardianship), reflecting a holistic Māori approach to place. Importantly, Māori GIS projects emphasize \*\*data sovereignty\*\* – Māori having control over data about Māori and their land:contentReference\[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference\[oaicite:1]{index=1}. This aligns with the concept that \*Māori data should be governed by Māori\*:contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2}. For example, the Ngāi Tahu-run Kā Huru Manu online atlas documents over 1,000 traditional Māori place-names in Te Waipounamu (South Island), illustrating iwi-led digital mapping:contentReference\[oaicite:3]{index=3}.



\## Key Principles



Māori GIS mapping is guided by Māori values and legal principles.  Central is \*\*Māori Data Sovereignty\*\*, which recognises that data about Māori (land, people, knowledge) should be subject to Māori governance:contentReference\[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference\[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  Māori and Indigenous data sovereignty broaden the general concept of data sovereignty (where data follows a nation’s laws):contentReference\[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference\[oaicite:7]{index=7}, by asserting that Māori have inherent rights over how their data is collected, owned, and used:contentReference\[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference\[oaicite:9]{index=9}. In practice, this means Māori mapping projects often use platforms that allow communities to control their data (see \*Takiwā\* below), and carefully protect sensitive cultural layers (e.g. wāhi tapu sites). As Landcare Research noted in a 2005 iwi case study, Māori were “blending cultural tikanga-based approaches with western technology” by developing their own GIS and information systems:contentReference\[oaicite:10]{index=10}. Respecting \*mana whenua\* (authority over land) and \*rangatiratanga\* (self-determination) is paramount: maps are seen not just as tools, but as assertions of identity and stewardship.



\## Tools and Platforms



Māori mappers use a mix of open-source and commercial GIS tools. Key platforms include:



\- \*\*\[QGIS](https://qgis.org)\*\* – A free, open-source desktop GIS with powerful mapping and analysis capabilities:contentReference\[oaicite:11]{index=11}. QGIS runs on multiple operating systems and is widely used in Aotearoa for community and iwi-led projects, since it incurs no licensing costs.  

\- \*\*ArcGIS Online\*\* – A commercial cloud GIS platform by Esri (USA) that enables interactive web maps, StoryMaps and dashboards. Many government agencies and some Māori organisations use ArcGIS for large-scale mapping.  

\- \*\*\[Takiwā (IDSov Aotearoa)](https://takiwa.co/)\*\* – A Māori-led web GIS platform built on Indigenous data sovereignty principles:contentReference\[oaicite:12]{index=12}. Takiwā is designed to integrate cultural and environmental data. For example, Māori landowners use Takiwā to store sensitive cultural information alongside environmental layers, showing how activities affect natural resources and wāhi tapu:contentReference\[oaicite:13]{index=13}. It enforces Māori control over data (data owners decide how stories and geodata are shared):contentReference\[oaicite:14]{index=14}. National initiatives like the NZ SeaRise programme also use Takiwā to share sea-level rise research with iwi and hapū:contentReference\[oaicite:15]{index=15}.  

\- \*\*OpenStreetMap (OSM)\*\* – A global open mapping project. Some Māori projects use OSM base data for roads and buildings, since it can be edited freely, though care must be taken with accuracy and local place names.  



Each link above points to authoritative sources or platforms: QGIS.org (open-source community project):contentReference\[oaicite:16]{index=16}, Takiwā.co (Māori geospatial network), etc. These tools provide free or collaborative mapping capabilities useful to Māori mappers.



\## Data Sources and Basemaps



Māori GIS practitioners rely on various data portals for geospatial layers and statistics:



\- \*\*\[LINZ Data Service](https://data.linz.govt.nz/)\*\* – The official Land Information NZ (Toitū Te Whenua) portal for NZ’s government spatial data. It offers open access to national datasets (topography, cadastre, elevation, aerial imagery, hydrography, etc.) at no cost. For instance, LINZ provides 1m-resolution LiDAR elevation models (open-licensed) covering all of New Zealand:contentReference\[oaicite:17]{index=17}. These basemaps and property data support detailed Māori land management and storytelling.  

\- \*\*Data.govt.nz (NZ Open Data Portal)\*\* – Central catalog of NZ government data. This site indexes over 28,000 datasets from 192 publishers, covering land, environment, society, infrastructure, and more:contentReference\[oaicite:18]{index=18}. Useful Māori-relevant data (e.g. conservation areas, census results, district plans) can be discovered here by searching keywords or iwi names.  

\- \*\*Stats NZ (Geographic Data Service \& ADE)\*\* – Statistics NZ publishes official geographies and census data. The Geographic Data Service provides shapefiles for boundaries (e.g. Māori Ward and Constituency boundaries), while the \*Aotearoa Data Explorer\* is an interactive platform (with API) for demographic and socio-economic data. These sources let Māori mappers integrate population and economic context (e.g. Māori population by area).  

\- \*\*Te Mana Raraunga Resources\*\* – While not a GIS data portal, the Māori Data Sovereignty network \*Te Mana Raraunga\* provides principles and tools (e.g. charter, community surveys) relevant for data collection and governance, which inform Māori GIS projects:contentReference\[oaicite:19]{index=19}.  

\- \*\*Other repositories\*\* – Relevant data can also be found via initiatives like Ka Huru Manu or local council GIS portals. For example, the \[Kā Huru Manu atlas](https://kahurumanu.co.nz/) (Ngāi Tahu project) publishes iwi-authored place names and map layers:contentReference\[oaicite:20]{index=20}.  



These sources ensure that the data underpinning Māori maps is authoritative and accessible. All listed links are official or community-led resources, e.g. LINZ and Stats NZ are government agencies, and Kā Huru Manu is an iwi project.
