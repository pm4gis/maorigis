This page describes common GIS workflows used across Māori organisations. These are practical patterns for how GIS work usually happens, from an idea through to an output that supports kōrero or decisions.

### A typical GIS workflow

Most work follows this sequence:

- Identify the question or need
- Gather relevant data
- Review and prepare the data
- Map or analyse the information
- Share outputs for kōrero or decisions
- Store data and outputs appropriately

Skipping steps often leads to confusion, rework, or misuse of information.

### Starting with purpose

Before opening any software, be clear about:

- What is being asked
- Who the information is for
- What decisions or kōrero it will support
- Whether outputs are internal or shared

Purpose guides the choice of data, level of detail, and how results are presented.

### Data gathering

Common sources include:

- Iwi or organisational datasets
- Public data from LINZ and councils
- Information from consultants or partners
- Field collected data
- Historical or legacy files

At this stage, note the source, ownership, and any conditions on use.

### Review and preparation

Good practice includes:

- Checking coordinate systems
- Reviewing attribute names and meaning
- Removing duplicates and obvious errors
- Separating sensitive data from general data

This step protects downstream users and avoids misunderstandings.

### Mapping and analysis

Examples include:

- Visualising rohe or areas of interest
- Overlaying projects with taiao layers
- Summarising information by area
- Creating maps for hui or reports

Analysis should match the audience. More complexity does not always add value.

### Outputs and sharing

Common outputs are:

- Static maps
- Interactive web maps
- Dashboards or StoryMaps
- Tables or summaries

Be deliberate about where outputs live, who can access them, and how long they remain relevant.

### Storage and care

Good practice includes:

- Keeping source data separate from outputs
- Using clear folder or database structures
- Recording basic metadata
- Respecting tikanga and permissions

GIS is ongoing mahi, not a one off task.
