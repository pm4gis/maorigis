Site data refers to specific locations of interest. These may be cultural, operational, environmental, or project related.



Sites are often mapped as points, but the meaning behind them is rarely simple.



\### Types of sites



Examples include:



\- Cultural or historical locations

\- Project or activity sites

\- Monitoring locations

\- Facilities or assets

\- Places used for engagement or hui



Each type may have different sensitivity and sharing expectations.



\### Points and place



A point on a map is a reference, not the place itself.



Consider:



\- Whether a site represents an area

\- Whether accuracy should be reduced

\- Whether descriptive detail should be limited



Points are indicators, not full representations.



\### Suggested basic schema for site data



A practical and respectful structure may include:



\- Site name or identifier

\- Site category

\- Short description

\- Source of information

\- Access or sensitivity notes



Avoid storing unnecessary detail if it increases risk.



\### Managing sensitive sites



Good practice includes:



\- Separate datasets for sensitive and general sites

\- Controlled access permissions

\- Clear naming and warnings

\- Avoiding public web maps unless appropriate

Just because a site can be mapped does not mean it should be shared.

\### Practical uses



Site data is often used to:



\- Support planning and logistics

\- Track activities or projects

\- Provide spatial context in hui

\- Link spatial and non spatial information



Sites are most useful when supported by clear context and care.



\### Moving between tools



Site data is commonly:



\- Collected in the field

\- Reviewed in desktop GIS

\- Shared through web maps or apps



Clear schemas at each step reduce risk and confusion.
