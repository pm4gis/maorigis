Taiao data supports understanding of environmental systems connected to whenua. This includes land, water, ecosystems, and change over time.



For many Māori organisations, taiao mapping supports kaitiakitanga and long term stewardship.



\### Common taiao datasets



Examples include:



\- Rivers, lakes, and catchments

\- Coastlines and marine areas

\- Vegetation and land cover

\- Monitoring sites

\- Flood, erosion, or hazard layers



These datasets usually come from councils, government agencies, or research providers.



\### Scale and accuracy



Environmental data is created at different scales.



Be careful not to:



\- Use regional data for site level decisions

\- Treat modelled data as exact

\- Ignore uncertainty or assumptions



Understanding scale helps avoid misinterpretation.



\### Suggested basic schema for taiao layers



A simple structure may include:



\- Feature name

\- Feature type

\- Source organisation

\- Data date

\- Notes or confidence field



This supports later interpretation and reuse.



\### Supporting kōrero



Taiao maps are often used to:



\- Explain environmental context

\- Support planning or funding applications

\- Track change over time

\- Communicate risks or constraints



Keep maps clear and focused.



\### Mātauranga considerations



Not all knowledge fits neatly into datasets.



Be cautious about:



\- Reducing mātauranga to points or polygons

\- Sharing information without context

\- Mixing public data with culturally specific knowledge



GIS should support kōrero, not flatten it.



\### Useful sources



Common sources include:



\- Regional council data portals

\- Ministry for the Environment

\- NIWA and research providers



Check update dates and intended use.
