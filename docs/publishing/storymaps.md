StoryMaps combine maps, text, images, and structure to tell a clear story. They are often well suited to Māori contexts where kōrero, place, and narrative matter.



This page focuses on practical use, not marketing or promotion.



\## What StoryMaps are good for



StoryMaps work well when you need to:



\- Explain context, not just data

\- Walk people through a place or issue

\- Combine maps with narrative

\- Support engagement and understanding



They are less suitable for detailed technical analysis.



\## Common Māori use cases



StoryMaps are often used for:



\- Sharing project context with whānau or communities

\- Explaining taiao or environmental work

\- Providing background for consultation

\- Telling the story of a place or kaupapa

\- Reporting progress in an accessible way



They help bridge the gap between technical GIS work and lived experience.



\## Keeping the story clear



A good StoryMap has a simple structure:



\- What this is about

\- Why it matters

\- Where it applies

\- What is happening or proposed

\- What comes next



Avoid overloading the map. Let the story lead.



\## Choosing the right level of detail



StoryMaps should show enough to understand the issue, but not everything.



Good practice:



\- Use simplified layers

\- Remove unnecessary attributes

\- Avoid exposing raw datasets

\- Use scale dependent visibility



If detailed data is needed, reference it rather than embedding it.



\## Te reo Māori in StoryMaps



Light use of te reo Māori can add meaning and respect.



Suggestions:



\- Use te reo in headings where appropriate

\- Use place names correctly with macrons

\- Avoid translating technical terms unless agreed

\- Keep language consistent and accurate



Do not use te reo decoratively. Use it where it adds value.



\## Review before sharing



Before publishing a StoryMap:



\- Review it with someone else

\- Check map sharing settings

\- Check all text for clarity and tone

\- Confirm permissions for images and data

\- View it as if you are seeing it for the first time



Once published, StoryMaps can be shared widely and quickly.



\## When not to use StoryMaps



Avoid StoryMaps when:



\- Information is sensitive or restricted

\- The content is contested

\- The audience needs raw data

\- Offline access is required



In those cases, static outputs or controlled sharing are better.
