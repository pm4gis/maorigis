Publishing maps is about turning internal GIS work into something that others can understand and use. In Māori contexts, publishing also involves decisions about mana, access, and responsibility.



This page focuses on practical ways to publish maps while keeping control of data and intent.



\## What publishing a map actually means



Publishing does not always mean making something public on the internet.



It can include:



\- A PDF map for a board paper

\- A static image for a report or funding application

\- A private web map shared only with staff or trustees

\- A public facing map with limited detail



The key question is not what tool you use, but who the map is for and what decisions it supports.



\## Common publishing options



Typical publishing approaches include:



\- Static maps exported from QGIS or ArcGIS Pro

\- Web maps hosted in ArcGIS Online

\- Maps embedded in reports or presentations

\- Maps included in StoryMaps for narrative context



Each option has different risks and benefits.



\## Static maps, low risk and predictable



Static maps are often the safest option.



Good uses include:



\- Hui packs

\- Board and trustee papers

\- Consultation material

\- Reports and funding applications



Benefits:



\- You control exactly what is shown

\- No live data connection

\- No accidental reuse of source data

\- Easy to archive and reference later



Good practice:



\- Include a title, date, and purpose

\- Include a small source note

\- Avoid showing raw sensitive layers

\- Use generalised boundaries where appropriate



\## Web maps, powerful but require care



Web maps allow people to pan, zoom, and explore information themselves.



They are useful when:



\- Multiple people need to view the same information

\- Context layers help explain a situation

\- Updates are expected over time



Risks to manage:



\- Layers can often be downloaded

\- Sharing settings can change accidentally

\- Attribute tables may expose sensitive information

\- Data may be reused outside its original kaupapa



If using ArcGIS Online:



\- Use private groups rather than public sharing

\- Disable data export where possible

\- Use hosted feature layer views to limit fields

\- Avoid publishing raw source datasets



\## Choosing what level of detail to show



Maps do not need to show everything you know.



A useful approach is to think in layers of detail:



\- Governance level maps show high level context

\- Operational maps show more detail but stay internal

\- Technical datasets remain unpublished



This separation protects sensitive information while still supporting kōrero.



\## A simple publishing checklist



Before publishing any map, check:



\- Who is the audience

\- What decision or kōrero it supports

\- Whether the data is appropriate for sharing

\- Whether the same output could be reused out of context

\- Whether a simpler map would still work



If you are unsure, choose the more cautious option.



\## Useful tools



\- QGIS print layouts for PDFs

\- ArcGIS Pro layouts for formal outputs

\- ArcGIS Online web maps for controlled sharing
