Sharing GIS outputs is often more complex than creating them. Once information leaves your control, it can be copied, reused, or misunderstood.



This page focuses on practical sharing approaches that respect kaupapa and protect relationships.



\## Sharing is a decision, not a default



Just because a map can be shared does not mean it should be.



Sharing should be intentional and agreed, especially when working with:



\- Whenua Māori

\- Sites of significance

\- Cultural landscapes

\- Sensitive environmental information



Ask early who can see what, and for how long.



\## Common sharing scenarios



Typical scenarios include:



\- Internal staff access

\- Trustee or board access

\- Partner agency access

\- Community engagement

\- Public information



Each scenario needs different controls.



\## Internal sharing



Internal sharing works best when:



\- Data lives in a shared drive or GIS workspace

\- Access is limited to named roles

\- Files are clearly versioned and dated



Good practice:



\- Separate source data from outputs

\- Use read only access where possible

\- Keep a simple register of shared datasets



\## Sharing with partners



When sharing with councils, Crown agencies, or consultants:



\- Share only what is required for the task

\- Provide context in writing, not just data

\- State any restrictions on reuse

\- Avoid sending raw working datasets unless needed



Where possible, share outputs rather than editable data.



\## Web sharing controls



If using web platforms:



\- Prefer private or group based access

\- Avoid public links unless intentional

\- Review sharing settings regularly

\- Understand that links can be forwarded



In ArcGIS Online:



\- Groups are safer than public sharing

\- Layer permissions matter more than map permissions

\- Turning off export reduces reuse risk



\## A simple access classification



Many organisations use a simple classification to guide sharing.



Example:



\- Public

\- Internal

\- Restricted

\- Sensitive



Record this classification in metadata or filenames so it travels with the data.



\## Managing expectations



Clear communication prevents problems.



When sharing, state:



\- What the data can be used for

\- What it should not be used for

\- Whether it is current or indicative

\- Who to contact with questions



This protects both you and the people using the information.



\## When not to share



Do not share when:



\- The data is incomplete or contested

\- Permissions are unclear

\- The risk outweighs the benefit

\- A map could be misunderstood without context



It is acceptable to say no or to delay sharing until conditions are clear.
