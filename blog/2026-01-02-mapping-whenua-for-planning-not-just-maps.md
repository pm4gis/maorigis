Most Māori GIS work is not about making maps for their own sake. It is about supporting decisions. Planning meetings, trust discussions, environmental reviews, funding applications. Maps are the evidence layer that sits underneath those kōrero.

A useful whenua map usually starts with one clear question. What decision is being supported. Once that is clear, everything else follows.

LINZ parcels are often the starting point, but they are rarely the end.

From there, planners often need overlays like zoning, hazards, waterways, or land use capability. Councils publish most of this data openly, although it is often spread across different portals.

Auckland Council example:

The key lesson is restraint. A planning map with too many layers becomes noise. One or two strong overlays, paired with clear labels and a scale bar, usually does more work than a complex layout.

For Māori organisations, planning maps should always include notes about uncertainty and source. Who supplied the data. When it was last updated. What it can and cannot be used for.

That context matters as much as the geometry.
