# Māori GIS Mapping in Aotearoa

Māori whānau, hapū and iwi across Aotearoa are increasingly using GIS (geographic information systems) to map their whenua (land), taonga (treasured places) and whakapapa (genealogies). Māori led mapping often blends Western GIS methods with tikanga (customary practice) and mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge). GIS tools help communities present information for resource management, cultural narratives, planning, and evidence for decisions.

## Data and software resources

A range of free data and tools can support Māori GIS work.

**Data**
- **LINZ Data Service (Toitū Te Whenua):** Cadastral parcels, topographic layers, elevation, hydro, coastline, and imagery access.
  https://data.linz.govt.nz/
- **Stats NZ:** Demographic and census information, including iwi related outputs and tools.
  https://www.stats.govt.nz/
- **data.govt.nz:** Cross agency catalogue for open datasets, including councils and CRIs.
  https://data.govt.nz/
- **NZ Geographic Board Gazetteer (LINZ):** Official place names, spelling, and macrons.
  https://gazetteer.linz.govt.nz/
- **Te Puni Kōkiri:** Information and resources that may include relevant community datasets and context.
  https://www.tpk.govt.nz/

**Software**
- **QGIS (free, open source):** Desktop GIS for mapping, analysis, and data preparation.
  https://qgis.org/
- **ArcGIS Online and StoryMaps (commercial):** Web maps and storytelling tools, often used by organisations already in the Esri ecosystem.

  https://storymaps.arcgis.com/
- **OpenStreetMap (open data):** Community editable basemaps and local features, including Māori place names when added carefully.

## Community projects and examples

Examples of Māori GIS in practice include work focused on place names, marae and cultural landscapes, environmental monitoring, and planning.

- **Māori place names in public maps:** Community mapping projects can add Māori names to shared basemaps and web maps, improving visibility and day to day use of correct names and macrons.
- **Environmental monitoring:** GIS is commonly used for restoration planning, monitoring sites, and reporting progress for predator control, riparian planting, wetlands, and coastal work.
- **Land planning and governance:** GIS supports Māori land trusts and incorporations with farm planning, land use change, leases, access, and infrastructure planning.
- **Treaty and historical evidence:** GIS can help organise and present spatial evidence for research, claims work, and long term archives, where appropriate permissions exist.

## Notes for Māori GIS work

- Keep a clear boundary between public maps and sensitive layers.
- Record permissions, provenance, and intended use for datasets and layers.
- Store macrons correctly in your data and outputs, including labels and metadata.
- Use separate layers or separate databases for restricted information, so it cannot be accidentally shared.
- When publishing, use the least detailed version that still meets the kaupapa.
