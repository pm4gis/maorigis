Phones are now standard GIS tools. The challenge is not the technology, but the structure of the data being collected.

Good field forms use drop downs, not free text. They capture photos consistently. They work offline.

For Māori projects, field data often includes tikanga notes or access restrictions. Those should be built into the form, not added later.

A good form saves time and reduces mistakes. A bad form creates cleanup work that never quite gets finished.
