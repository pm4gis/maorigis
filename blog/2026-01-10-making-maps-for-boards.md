Maps for boards are not technical documents. They are decision tools.

Trustees want to know what is changing, what the risks are, and what choices exist. They do not need to see every layer.

Effective board maps use large labels, simple legends, and minimal colour. They focus attention on the issue at hand.

One strong map is better than five average ones.

Always leave time for questions. The map is only part of the kōrero.
