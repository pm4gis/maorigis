QGIS works well for rural Māori projects because it does not assume constant internet access or large teams. It runs on a laptop, works offline, and supports a wide range of data formats.

The official QGIS site is here:
https://qgis.org/

For rural projects, common tasks include loading LINZ imagery, viewing parcels, and digitising features like tracks, wetlands, or fencing.

LINZ Basemaps integrate cleanly with QGIS:

One practical tip is to always set your project projection to NZTM2000 at the start. This avoids subtle alignment issues later.

Another tip is to keep your layer list short. Rural mapping benefits from clarity. Too many layers slow down both the computer and the conversation.

QGIS styles can be saved and reused, which helps keep maps consistent across time and projects. That consistency builds trust with boards and whānau who see the maps repeatedly.

QGIS does not lock you in. Your data stays yours.
