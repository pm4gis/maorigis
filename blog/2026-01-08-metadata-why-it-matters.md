Metadata is the part of GIS everyone agrees is important and then forgets to do.

At a minimum, every dataset should record who created it, when, why, and what its limits are.

LINZ provides good examples of clear metadata:

For Māori organisations, metadata is also about authority and permission. Who can use this data. Who cannot. Under what conditions.

Without metadata, data becomes risky. With metadata, it becomes usable over time.

Future you will thank present you for writing it down.
