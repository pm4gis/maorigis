Place names are more than labels. They carry history, events, and relationships to land.

LINZ maintains the official gazetteer:
https://gazetteer.linz.govt.nz/

Many Māori place names exist outside the gazetteer, held within iwi and hapū knowledge. GIS can support the recording of those names, but only when governance is clear.

Public maps are not always the right place for sensitive names. Sometimes a private layer, shared only within the whānau or trust, is more appropriate.

When adding Māori place names to maps, spelling and macrons matter. Consistency matters. Context matters.

A name without its story is incomplete.
