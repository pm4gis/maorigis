National basemaps are useful, but sometimes local imagery tells a better story.

Local basemaps can be built from drone imagery, scanned photos, or council datasets. The key is georeferencing and consistency.

QGIS supports this workflow well:

Local basemaps are especially useful for small catchments, pā sites, or restoration areas where national imagery lacks detail.

Keep them internal unless you are confident about permissions and sensitivity.

Local knowledge, mapped carefully, is powerful.
