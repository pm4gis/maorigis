Flooding maps are becoming part of everyday decision making. Insurance, planting, infrastructure, and housing are all affected.

Most regional councils publish flood hazard layers. These are usually modelled, not observed. That distinction matters.

Example flood data sources:

For Māori land, flood maps should be read alongside historical imagery. Retrolens is particularly useful for this.

If an area flooded regularly in the 1940s, that history should carry weight even if modern models suggest otherwise.

Flood maps should never be presented without explanation. They describe probability, not certainty. When working with marae or trusts, time should be spent explaining what the colours mean and what assumptions sit underneath.

Maps can inform. They should not frighten or oversimplify.
