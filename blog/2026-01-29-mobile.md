Long term stream and taiao monitoring works best when it starts simple and stays consistent. Many projects fail not because of poor data collection, but because the structure of the data was never agreed at the start.



This post outlines a practical way to design a small, clear data schema and taxonomy for a monitoring site. The focus is on a single fixed location where photos, observations, and measurements are collected over time. This suits hapū, marae, land trusts, schools, and kaitiaki groups working in rural settings.



\## What is meant by a data schema and taxonomy

A data schema is the agreed structure of your data. It defines what fields exist, what type they are, and what they mean.



A taxonomy is the controlled set of values you allow in those fields. It avoids free text where possible and helps ensure consistency over time and across people.



You do not need a complex database to do this well. A clear form and a simple table is enough.



\## Start with the monitoring site, not the measurements

Begin by defining the site itself. This rarely changes and should be captured once.



Typical site fields:

\- site\_id

\- site\_name

\- location (point geometry)

\- catchment or rohe

\- stream name

\- description

\- access notes

\- tikanga or sensitivity notes

\- established\_date



This becomes the anchor for everything else. Every observation links back to this site\_id.



\## Designing the core observation record

Each visit to the site produces one observation record. Even if multiple photos or tests are taken, they belong to one visit.



Core observation fields:

\- observation\_id

\- site\_id

\- date

\- time

\- observer name or group

\- weather conditions

\- recent rainfall (none, light, heavy)

\- notes



Keep these fields short and repeatable. Avoid long narrative text unless necessary.



\## Adding a fixed photo point

A fixed photo point is one of the most valuable and simplest monitoring tools.



Recommended photo fields:

\- photo\_id

\- observation\_id

\- photo\_direction (upstream, downstream, bank, general)

\- camera height category (ground, chest, tripod)

\- photo\_file



Guidance:

\- Stand in the same place each time.

\- Face the same direction.

\- Take the photo at a similar height.

\- Do not overthink precision. Consistency matters more.



\## Water quality measurements

Only collect what you can realistically maintain.



Common basic water fields:

\- water\_temperature

\- clarity or turbidity (visual scale if needed)

\- flow condition (low, normal, high)

\- visual algae presence (none, light, heavy)

\- odour present (yes or no)



If you are using test kits:

\- pH

\- nitrate

\- phosphate

\- conductivity



Reference standards and guidance:

\- NIWA freshwater monitoring resources  

 https://niwa.co.nz/freshwater-and-estuaries/freshwater-quality  

\- Ministry for the Environment freshwater information  

 https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/freshwater/



Be clear about method and kit type in your metadata. Results without method context are hard to compare later.



\## Flora and fauna observations

Avoid full species inventories unless you have training. Presence and change over time is often enough.



Flora fields:

\- vegetation type (riparian grass, native shrubs, exotic trees)

\- canopy cover estimate (low, medium, high)

\- notable species present



Fauna fields:

\- birds observed (tick list)

\- fish observed (yes or no)

\- invertebrates observed (none, some, many)

\- pest species signs



Use pick lists rather than free text wherever possible.



\## Example simple taxonomy values

Examples of controlled values that work well:



Weather:

\- fine

\- cloudy

\- light rain

\- heavy rain



Flow:

\- low

\- normal

\- high

\- flooding



Algae:

\- none

\- light

\- moderate

\- heavy



These may feel basic, but they are far more useful over time than inconsistent descriptions.



\## Tools for collecting the data

Mobile data collection tools reduce errors and enforce your schema.



Good options:

\- KoboToolbox  

 https://www.kobotoolbox.org  

\- ArcGIS Survey123  

 https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-survey123/overview  



Both support:

\- mandatory fields

\- drop down taxonomies

\- photo capture

\- offline use

\- GPS location capture



KoboToolbox is free and open, well suited to community and kaupapa Māori projects. Survey123 integrates tightly with ArcGIS Online and works well if you are already using Esri tools.



\## Linking your data to GIS

Each observation should link spatially to the site point. This allows:

\- mapping change over time

\- linking photos to maps

\- combining with catchment, land use, or rainfall data



Useful national data sources:

\- LINZ basemaps and catchments  

 https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz  

\- NIWA climate and hydrology data  

 https://niwa.co.nz/climate  

\- Regional council water monitoring portals, for comparison data



\## Councils and reference datasets

Some councils publish long running water quality and ecology datasets. These are useful for context, not as a replacement for local monitoring.



Examples:

\- Auckland Council freshwater monitoring  

 https://environmentauckland.org.nz  

\- Waikato Regional Council water quality data  

 https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/environment/environmental-information/  



If you can see data clearly on a public map, it often exists as a service you can reference in your own GIS, subject to licence terms.



\## Keep provenance and tikanga visible

Every dataset should record:

\- who collected it

\- why it was collected

\- how it can be shared

\- what should not be shared publicly



This can be a simple text field, but it matters.



\## Final thoughts

A good monitoring schema is boring on purpose. It avoids cleverness and focuses on repeatability. Over years, a simple photo taken from the same place, paired with basic observations, becomes powerful evidence of change.



Start small. Write the schema down. Lock it in. Then focus on showing up and collecting the data consistently.
